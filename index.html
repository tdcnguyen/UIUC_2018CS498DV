                            <p>The narrative visualization for this project follows an interactive slideshow structure. The project uses data from the <a href="https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/">NASA Exoplanet Archive</a>, specifically the <a href="https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=planets">Confirmed Planets Table</a>. The narrative for these data is presented in three scenes. These three scenes are titled Time, Space, and Life, respectively. The first scene, Time, provides the viewer with an overview of exoplanet discovery over time. The next scene, Space, shows the viewer where in the sky exoplanets have been found. The final scene, Life, puts the current state of exoplanet discovery into perspective with the search for life in the Universe.
                            <p>The rubric for this project is as follows:</p>
                            <li><b>Does the narrative visualization correctly follow the hybrid structure as stated by the essay?</b></li>
                            <p>This visualization follows the interactive slideshow structure, and consists of three scenes. The three scenes are designed to reveal information about exoplanet discovery progressively. Furthermore, each scene allows the viewer to interactively manipulate the visualization to improve their understanding of the data.</p>
                            <p>The first scene, Time, provides the viewer with an overview of exoplanet discovery over time using a histogram. The scale and ordinates of the histogram can be changed by the viewer to understand the statistics better.</p>
                            <p>The second scene, Space, shows the viewer the locations of exoplanet discoveries in the sky using a scatter plot. The location of the exoplanets can be filtered by the viewer so that only cumulative discoveries up to a particular year are displayed. This filter allows the viewer to observe how our planet search campaigns have progressed across the sky.</p>
                            <p>The third scene, Life, relays some physical parameters related to exoplanets using a scatter plot. The scatter plot illustrates the distance between the exoplanet and its host star as a function of the mass of the host star using plotting position, and the exoplanet mass using symbol size. These physical parameters are crucial to determining the habitability of an exoplanet to support life. The viewer can filter exoplanets by mass so that only cumulative discoveries up to a particular planet mass are displayed. This filter allows the viewer to see how the population of confirmed exoplanets compares to Earth.</p>
                            <p>A common color scheme was applied to all three scenes to distinguish the different methods of exoplanet detection used for discovery. In addition, throughout the narrative, the viewer interacts with the visualization using buttons, tooltips and sliders. Furthermore, annotations are available in the visualizations to aid the user.</p>
                            <li><b>Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize scenes?</b></li>
                            <p>This narrative partitions the topic of exoplanet discovery into three scenes. First, the user is introduced to an overview of the discovery of exoplanets through time with a histogram. Next, the user is shown the exoplanet discoveries as they were found in the sky with a scatter plot. Finally, physical parameters related to exoplanets are illustrated to the user with a scatter plot.</p>
                            <li><b>Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize annotations?</b></li>
                            <p>This narrative visualization contains annotations in every scene. Every scene has tooltips to aid and provide additional information to the user.</p>
                            <p>In the first scene (Time), the tooltip shows the exoplanet discovery method and number of discoveries or proportion of discoveries when the mouse is over the plot. In the second and third scenes (Space and Life), the tooltip shows the name of the planet that the mouse is over.</p>
                            <p>Additional information is also displayed with text boxes at appropriate times as the user manipulates the visualization. In the second scene (Space), a text box mentioning the Kepler space observatory appears when the user includes discoveries on or after 2009, and the Kepler field is highlighted when the user includes discoveries on or after 2014. In the third scene (Life), a text box discussing the sensitivity of different exoplanet search methods appears when the user includes exoplanets more massive than 1000 Earths, and another text box discussing the current rarity of finding Earth-like exoplanets when the user excludes exoplanets more massive than 10 Earths.</p>
                            <li><b>Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize parameters?</b></li>
                            <p>This visualization shows the user the parameters and current state of each scene as its manipulated.</p>
                            <p>In the first scene (Time), the y-axis can be changed by clicking the available buttons: the y-axis can be a trimmed to better show the data, the y-axis can be zoomed out to show all of the data, and the y-axis can be altered to show relative proportions between data categories. In all three scenes, buttons show whether annotations are turned on or off. In every scene, buttons are highlighted to indicate that they are activated.</p>
                            <p>Numerical values associated with sliders are dynamically updated. In the second and third scenes (Space and Life), the value of the slider is updated to indicate which subset of exoplanets is displayed to the user.</p>
                            <li><b>Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize triggers?</b></li>
                            <p>This visualization uses buttons, sliders, and mouse-over tooltips as triggers to control the narrative.</p>
                            <p>In the first scene (Time), buttons are used to alter the y-axis. When a button to change the y-axis is clicked, the plot is re-drawn and the clicked button is colored blue to indicate that it was selected. Furthermore, two buttons are available in every scene to toggle annotations. The annotation buttons are colored blue when they are selected.</p>
                            <p>In the second and third scene (Space and Life), sliders are used to filter the data that is displayed. In the second scene (Space), the slider allows the user to show a subset of the exoplanets that were discovered up to a particular year, and the range of years is displayed above the slider. In the third scene (Life), the slider allows the user to show a subset of the exoplanets up to a chosen mass, and the mass limit is displayed above the slider.</p>
                            <p>Finally, in every scene, there are tooltips that are activated by mouse-overs. As mentioned previously, the mouse-over tooltip shows counts, and planet names for the first scene (Time), and second and third scenes (Space and Life), respectively.</p>

                        <p>The earliest announced exoplanet discovery that was later confirmed was that of Gamma Cephei in 1989. This discovery was made using the radial velocity method. This method uses periodic variations in the velocity of a star toward and away from us to indicate the presence of an exoplanet orbiting that star. Exoplanet detection using radial velocities was the most popular technique until 2010 when it was overtaken by the transit search method. Currently, more exoplanets have been discovered using transit searches than any other method to date. In particular, the transit search of the Kepler space observatory has discovered more confirmed exoplanets than all other efforts combined thus far.</p>

                        <p>One of the most profound questions that humankind has sought to answer is whether we are alone in the Universe. The underlying goal of exoplanet programs is to discover habitable planets, i.e., planets that are similar to Earth and can support life as we know it. These habitable planets cannot neither be too close to nor too far from their host star, and are thought to have orbits with semi-major axes that would allow for liquid water to exist on or near its surface. The inner and outer radius of the habitable zone are indicated in the plot below by the dotted and dashed lines, respectively. Furthermore, even within this narrow band of habitable distance from a star, habitable planets are thought to be mostly solid and not gas giants, therefore, they cannot be too massive. Only a handful of the thousands of confirmed exoplanets are within the habitable zone and have masses similar to Earth.</p>
                        <p>The following visualization shows a scatter plot of the orbital semi-major axis and host star mass of confirmed exoplanets. The orbital semi-major axis of a planet is essentially the distance between the planet and its host star.</p>
